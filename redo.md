# My initial thoughts on github
Througout this tutorial, I learned how to use all (or at least most of) features of github and how the user can take advantage of each one.. For example, you are able to make branches and experiment with new ideas while leaving your original repository unaffected. As well as the idea of forking other people's work to sort of allow you to play around with their code.

Since I'm still new to github, I'm still relatively confused about where everything is found and how to actually access each feature. This will ease in overtime as I continue to use github..

Here is my code to calculate the properties of a circle:
